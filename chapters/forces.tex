The Jacobian formulation introduced in \cref{sec:invjac} pertains to the field known as \emph{Differential Kinematics}, which relates joint velocities with end-effector linear and angular velocities. The (geometric) Jacobian represents a fundamental tool to characterize the motion and the interaction of a robot with its environment, as it is used to perform the following:
  i) inverse differential kinematics even for robots that do not have a closed-form solution (cf. \cref{sec:invjac});
 ii) singularity analysis (a kinematic singularity is a robot configuration in which the robot loses the ability to move to one or more directions \cite{sciavicco2012modelling});
iii) redundancy analysis (a kinematic task is redundant if the robot possesses more degrees of freedom than what are needed to perform the task, resulting in infinite inverse kinematics solutions to choose from \cite{sciavicco2012modelling});
 iv) manipulability analysis (i.e. how easy or difficult is it for a robot to move in a certain direction \cite{sciavicco2012modelling}).
In this Chapter, we will investigate the role of the Jacobian in relating forces and moments applied at the end-effector and the resulting joint torques at equilibrium configurations--a field usually referred to as \emph{Statics}.
