abstract = {We present a soft, amorphous skin that can sense and localize textures. The skin consists of a series of sensing and computing elements that are networked with their local neighbors and mimic the function of the Pacinian corpuscle in human skin. Each sensor node samples a vibration signal at 1 KHz, transforms the signal into the frequency domain, and classifies up to 15 textures using logistic regression. By measuring the power spectrum of the signal and comparing it with its local neighbors, computing elements can then collaboratively estimate the location of the stimulus. The resulting low-bandwidth information, consisting of the texture probability distribution and its location are then routed to a sink anywhere in the skin in a multi-hop fashion. We describe the design, manufacturing, classification, localization and networking algorithms and experimentally validate the proposed approach. In particular, we demonstrate texture classification with 71% accuracy and centimeter accuracy in localization over an area of approximately three square feet using ten networked sensor nodes.},
